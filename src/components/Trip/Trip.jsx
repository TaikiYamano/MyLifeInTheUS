                    I didn’t visit a lot of places while studying abroad becase I was so busy with studying. But I visited NewYork City twice, and Niagara Falls twice.

                        Niagara Falls was very amazing and powerful place! I had only seen it in books and on videos,<br/>so I was very glad to see
                        the real one! 
                        In Niagara Falls, I got on a ship and could see Niagara Falls very close up! <br/>
                        It was so dynamic and beautiful! If you like nature, I recomend to visit here!<br/>

                        Visiting New York City is one of the best memories in my life! <br/>
                        The first time, I  went to the countdown at Times Square in New York on New Year’s Eve with my friends! <br/>
                        It was so crowded at Times Square and my friends and me waited until the countdown was started<br/>
                        (we were wating for the countdown around 12 hours...), so we were so tired.<br/> But I think I had a valuable experience I had never experienced.<br/>
                        On the following day, my friends and me visit Grand Central Station and Liberty Island<br/>
                        that is famous for the Statue of Liberty.  The second time, I visted NYC to went sightseeing<br/>and enjoy some popular food in NYC. <br/>
                        If I have a chance, I would like to visit America and NYC again!
