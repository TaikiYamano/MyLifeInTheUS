                        I studied in ELS that was added to The Collage at BROCKPORT that was in Rochester in New York State,<br/>
                        and Istudied English mainly. Rochester  was country side, so I have nothing to do, <br/>
                        but it was kind of good place to focus on studying.

                        I studied abroad as a collage program, so almost all classmates were Japanese, <br/>
                        and I felt like it’s a little bit difficult to learn English in classes because we can speak Japanese in classes. <br/>
                        However, I didn’t gave up to learn English, I always try to speak in English to improve my English skills more.
